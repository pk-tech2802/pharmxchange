## Project Pharmxchange
Sabak ek ko seekh hum sabko
Our objective is to increase medical awareness using a different approach but something like "SABAK EK KO SEEKH HUM SABKO." Our major goal is to utilize to assist people learn from the wisdom of others, and our objective is to establish a database that will be used by hospitals and medical practitioners all over the world to help in treating patients at a lower cost and with better care.

The database will function as follows:
Whenever a patient is discharged or entirely treated. The hospital staff is obligated to create a treatment file as part of the billing process and to maintain track of records, which they will now upload to our database using easy processes. Now, this data will be available to healthcare personnel who will not have access to the patient's personal information; they will be able to view the data and comment on it; some data will be partially available to the public, and only authorized personnel such as doctors or hospital staff who treated the person will be able to contact him if necessary.

The medical student can examine what symptoms an illness may exhibit or what treatments are available to address a disease fusion.

Other doctors whose patients exhibit different symptoms can check the database to see what treatments are available, or they can call the doctor, and if the patient's financial situation is poor, they can look for the most cost-effective treatment.
